# project-prediction_stock_price


## Overview
This project involves the development and training of an LSTM model to predict stock prices. The workflow includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation on multiple datasets. The primary goal is to predict the stock prices of various companies using historical data and a sequential neural network model.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Development**: Building and training an LSTM model using the processed data.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance on test data and visualizing the results.
